Special Notes for Included Code
============================================================================

MissingH includes some code from other authors.  The copyright and license
statements for these sources are included below.  All are GPL-compatible
licenses, so if you have any doubt about how to treat MissingH as a whole,
simply know that the GPL should be understood to cover the entire library.

If you split out the parts originally from other authors, and use them
completely independently of the rest of the library, you may treat them
under the licenses shown below.

----------------------------------------------------
The MissingH.Hsemail modules come from hsemail 2004-10-24 from 
http://cryp.to/hsemail/.

Copyright/License:

  Copyright (c) 2004 Peter Simons <simons@cryp.to>. All rights reserved. This
  software is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

I (John Goerzen) have made these modifications:

 * Module names adjusted to work with MissingH, and to not conflict
   with user-installed copies of hsemail

 * Some files from the source distribution are not relevant to MissingH
   and were removed.

The Wash modules come from WashNGo 2.0.5.  Mail is version 0.3.7.  Utility
is version 0.3.11.   They are available from
