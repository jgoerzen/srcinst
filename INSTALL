INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

First, install the Cabal distribution for your favorite compiler.
Get it from http://www.haskell.org/cabal.  Debian users can
apt-get install libghc6-cabal-dev.  Then run "make setup" (you may
need to edit the Makefile if you don't use GHC or if your GHC is at an
unusual location).

Then:

 ./setup configure
 ./setup build
 ./setup install
 
Optionally, to run the unit tests, you'll need to install HUnit.  Then:

 make test-ghc6

or:

 make test-hugs
